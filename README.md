# AFC-DDSD-Interview

I've uploaded four HTML documents and one VBA spreadsheet that are representative of the coding/problems I've worked on during my time at NPS.  Each HTML file contains code either created by Jupyter notebook or R Studio and is the final product of an assignment.
1. OA3801 Project-Wren.html - My portion of a Python group project where I identified counties vulnerable to COVID-19 during early March based on demographics, economic data, and hospital capacity.
2. OA4106 Project - Wren.html - R project conducting time series regression to predict social unrest using open source information.
3. OA3802 Lab 2 - Wren.html - Python assignment utilizing web scraping and fuzzy merge operations to determine particular statistics.
4. OA3802 Lab 3 - Wren.html - Python assignment utilizing Twitter scraping and natural language processing to identify sentiment following the final presidential debate.
5. OA4801 Project - Wren.xlsm - VBA assignment utilizing graph theory to analyze in/out degree centrality and implementing a shortest path algorithm.

For a deeper dive, I'm including folders with data and markdowns.  However, some aspects/raw data related to the assignment were not uploaded due to file size limitations.
